Monster v 1.0

Overview:

Monster is equipped with an autoconfigure feature. During first startup you're going to be

more time just delete your current configuration file or rename it.It's going to be like this:

During next startup a configurator will set a new config file for you. Note that you're going
to answer those questions again.
